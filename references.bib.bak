  review = {(taken from Amazon)
	
	
	Whenever you think about learning Solid State Physics, or the first
	stage of Condensed Matter Physics for college level, the Ashcroft/Mermin
	book is always the first textbook that you should chose. It covers
	almost everything basic carefully.
	
	But a couple of things make the evaluation lower.
	
	First, and obviously, the book is too old. It was published 18 years
	ago and never got any new edition. During this long long long time,
	Solid State Physics has already changed much. Semiconductors are
	already the most important topics and the discoveries of high Tc
	Superconductivity and Quantum Hall Effect in low dimensional systems
	have already largely switched people's interest in physics of Solid
	to a regime stressed on interactions and disorders... Many books
	start trying to put these topics together, but nothing better than
	seeing a new version of Ashcroft/Mermin with the new topics well
	integrated in.
	
	The other one is about the presentation of this book. I just taught
	the class of Solid State Physics last year for the first time, and
	it turns out the presentation of the book is not so friendly to everyone.
	The chaptors of Nearly free electrons and Tight Binding model of
	the Band Theory are made fairly long, while not constructed in the
	best way, resulting in the puzzle of many students. Of course, if
	you study carefully, you still can get the ideas, but a lot of time
	is wasted. Considering the importance of these chaptors, this really
	pulls back the evaluation of the book. My suggestion is, when you
	study Solid State Physics, have more books as your reference, don't
	stick only on A/M when you feel troubled, although the A/M is still
	the best one in general.
	
	I really hope the new edition of this book comes out soon, but considering
	the age of the authors, it may never happen.},

	to find the effective behavior of composites in the quasistatic limit,
	presents the quasistatic equations of elastodynamic and electromagnetic

	the plane wave expansion of sources as well as scattering from curved
	interfaces, specifically spheres and cylinders. The author then covers
	electrodynamic, acoustic, and elastodynamic metamaterials. He also
	describes examples of transformations, aspects of acoustic cloaking,
	and applications of pentamode materials to acoustic cloaking. With
	a focus on periodic composites, the text uses the Bloch-Floquet theorem
	to find the effective behavior of composites in the quasistatic limit,
	presents the quasistatic equations of elastodynamic and electromagnetic
	waves, and investigates Brillouin zones and band gaps in periodic
	structures. The final chapter discusses wave propagation in smoothly
	varying layered media, anisotropic density of a periodic layered
	medium, and quasistatic homogenization of laminates.
	
	
	This book provides a launch pad for research into elastic and acoustic
	metamaterials. Many of the ideas presented have yet to be realized
	experimentally—the book encourages readers to explore these ideas
	and bring them to technological maturity.},

	of the BEM technology that has occurred in the last decade, describes
	the formulation of boundary element methods for almost all applications
	of the method. For ease of use, a simple utilitarian and tutorial
	approach is adopted in the initial chapters, introducing the basic
	background needed to learn the method. Simple but detailed instructions
	for its application to heat transfer and stress analyses are then
	dealt with, before moving on to more complex formulations in the

  abstract = {Purely numerical methods based on finite-element approximation of
	the acoustic or elastic wave equation are becoming increasingly popular
	for the generation of synthetic seismograms. We present formulas
	for the grid dispersion and stability criteria for some popular finite-element
	methods (FEM) for wave propagation, namely, classical and spectral
	FEM. We develop an approach based on a generalized eigenvalue formulation
	to analyze the dispersive behavior of these FEMs for acoustic or
	elastic wave propagation that overcomes difficulties caused by irregular
	node spacing within the element and the use of high-order polynomials,
	as is the case for spectral FEM. Analysis reveals that for spectral
	FEM of order four or greater, dispersion is less than 0.2\% at four
	to five nodes per wavelength, and dispersion is not angle dependent.
	New results can be compared with grid-dispersion results of some
	classical finite-difference methods (FDM) used for acoustic or elastic
	wave propagation. Analysis reveals that FDM and classical FEM require
	a larger sampling ratio than a spectral FEM to obtain results with
	the same degree of accuracy. The staggered-grid FDM is an efficient
	scheme, but the dispersion is angle dependent with larger values
	along the grid axes. On the other hand, spectral FEM of order four
	or greater is isotropic with small dispersion, making it attractive
	for simulations with long propagation times.},

	scenario, an Mw 7.8 earthquake on a portion of the San Andreas fault
	in southern California, conducted by three different groups at the
	Southern California Earthquake Center using the SCEC Community Velocity
	Model for this region. We conducted two simulations using the finite
	difference method, and one by the finite element method, and performed
	qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the corresponding
	results. The results are in good agreement with each other; only
	small differences occur both in amplitude and phase between the various
	synthetics at ten observation points located near and away from the
	fault—as far as 150 km away from the fault. Using an available goodness-of-fit
	criterion all the comparisons scored above 8, with most above 9.2.
	This score would be regarded as excellent if the measurements were
	between recorded and synthetic seismograms. We also report results
	of comparisons based on time–frequency misfit criteria. Results from
	these two criteria can be used for calibrating the two methods for
	comparing seismograms. In those cases in which noticeable discrepancies
	occurred between the seismograms generated by the three groups, we
	found that they were the product of inherent characteristics of the
	various numerical methods used and their implementations. In particular,
	we found that the major source of discrepancy lies in the difference
	between mesh and grid representations of the same material model.
	Overall, however, even the largest differences in the synthetic seismograms
	are small. Thus, given the complexity of the simulations used in
	this verification, it appears that the three schemes are consistent,
	reliable and sufficiently accurate and robust for use in future large-scale
	simulations.},

  abstract = {This article reports on the development of a modular two-step, finite-element
	methodology for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous
	localized regions with large contrasts in wavelengths. We target
	complex geological structures such as sedimentary basins and ridges
	that are some distance away from the earthquake source. We overcome
	the problem of multiple physical scales by subdividing the original
	problem into two simpler ones. The first is an auxiliary problem
	that simulates the earthquake source and propagation path effects
	with a model that encompasses the source and a background structure
	from which the localized feature has been removed. The second problem
	models local site effects. Its input is a set of equivalent localized
	forces derived from the first step. These forces act only within
	a single layer of elements adjacent to the interface between the
	exterior region and the geological feature of interest. This enables
	us to reduce the domain size in the second step. If the background
	subsurface structure is simple, one can replace the finite-element
	method in the first step with an alternative efficient method. The
	methodology is illustrated in a companion paper (Yoshimura et al.,
	2003) for several 3D problems of increasing physical and computational
	complexity. We consider first a flat-layered, stratigraphic system.
	For this simple case, the first step can be carried out by means
	of 3D Green's function evaluations. The extension to more general
	problems is illustrated by two examples: a basin and a hill, with
	the same background stratigraphy. To verify the two-step procedure
	with a problem for which the finite-element method is used throughout,
	we model ground motion in a small region of the Los Angeles Basin,
	using both the two-step domain-reduction method and the traditional
	approach in which the computational domain contains both the source
	and the geological region of interest.},

  abstract = {A method based on a discrete horizontal wave-number representation
	of seismic-source wave fields is developed and applied to the study
	of the near-field of a seismic source embedded in a layered medium.
	The discretization results from a periodicity assumption in the description
	of the source. The problem is basically two-dimensional but its extension
	to three dimensions is sometimes feasible. The source is quite general
	and is represented through its body-force equivalents. Tests of the
	accuracy of the method are made against Garvin's (1956) analytical
	solution (a buried line source in a half-space) and against Niazy's
	(1973) results for a propagating fault in an infinite medium. In
	both cases, a remarkably good agreement is found. The method is applied
	to the modeling of the San Fernando earthquake, and to the computation
	of synthetic seismograms at short distance from a complex source
	in a layered medium. In particular, we show that the high acceleration-high
	frequency phase of the Pacoima Dam records is due to the Rayleigh
	wave from the point of ground breakage. Other high-acceleration phases,
	predicted by our model, are associated with the shear-wave arrival
	from the hypocenter or result from changes in the fault orientation.},

  abstract = {This article documents a comparative exercise for numerical simulation
	of ground motion, addressing the seismic response of the Grenoble
	site, a typical Alpine valley with complex 3D geometry and large
	velocity contrasts. Predictions up to 2 Hz were asked for four different
	structure wave-field configurations (point source and extended source,
	with and without surface topography). This effort is part of a larger
	exercise organized for the third international symposium on the effects
	of surface geology (ESG 2006), the complete results of which are
	reported elsewhere (Tsuno et al., 2009).
	
	
	While initial, blind computations significantly differed from one
	another, a remarkable fit was obtained after correcting for some
	nonmethodological errors for four 3D methods: the arbitrary high-order
	derivative discontinuous Galerkin method (ADER-DGM), the velocity-stress
	finite-difference scheme on an arbitrary discontinuous staggered
	grid (FDM), and two implementations of the spectral-element method
	(SEM1 and SEM2). Their basic formulation is briefly recalled, and
	their implementation for the Grenoble Valley and the corresponding
	requirements in terms of computer resources are detailed.
	
	
	Besides a visual inspection of PGV maps, more refined, quantitative
	comparisons based on time-frequency analysis greatly help in understanding
	the origin of differences, with a special emphasis on phase misfit.
	The match is found excellent below 1 Hz, and gradually deteriorates
	for increasing frequency, reflecting differences in meshing strategy,
	numerical dispersion, and implementation of damping properties. While
	the numerical prediction of ground motion cannot yet be considered
	a mature, push-button approach, the good agreement reached by four
	participants indicates that, when used properly, numerical simulation
	is actually able to handle correctly wave radiation from extended
	sources in complex 3D media. The main recommendation to obtain reliable
	numerical predictions of earthquake ground motion is to use at least
	two different but comparably accurate methods, for instance the present
	formulations and implementations of the FDM, SEM, and ADER-DGM.},

	propagation on a global scale. Two aspects relevant to low-frequency
	studies are particularly emphasized. First, the method is generalized
	beyond the Cowling approximation in order to fully account for the
	effects of self-gravitation. In particular, the perturbation of the
	gravity field outside the Earth is handled by a projection of the
	spectral element solution onto the basis of spherical harmonics.
	Second, we propose a new formulation inside the fluid which allows
	us to account for an arbitrary density stratification. It is based
	upon a decomposition of the displacement into two scalar potentials,
	and results in a fully explicit fluid–solid coupling strategy. The
	implementation of the method is carefully detailed and its accuracy
	is demonstrated through a series of benchmark tests.},

  abstract = {The mechanical behavior of open-cell foams may be modeled either on
	a microscopic or a macroscopic scale. In the first case, the behavior
	of the individual cell walls is described by beam models, while in
	the second case a continuum mechanical approach is applied. Both
	approaches have different advantages: On the one hand, the microscopic
	approach allows for a simple formulation of the constitutive equations
	but requires detailed knowledge of the heterogeneous microstructure,
	e.g. geometrical data of the beams and of the topology, and becomes
	numerically expensive for large structures. On the other hand, the
	macroscopic approach leads to efficient computations but requires
	more complicated constitutive equations, if e.g. anisotropy is taken
	into account. In the present contribution the advantages of the microscopic
	and macroscopic descriptions are combined by a numerical so-called
	second order homogenization scheme. Therefore, a small but representative
	element of the microstructure consisting of a few beam elements is
	chosen and attached to the quadrature points of the macroscopic finite
	element model. The macroscopic model is formulated in the framework
	of a Cosserat continuum, which allows to take care of size effects.
	The macroscopic strain and curvature tensors are projected onto the
	microstructure leading to a deformation mode of the beam ensemble.
	The resulting forces and moments in the beams are homogenized by
	an appropriate averaging procedure defining the corresponding stresses
	and couple stresses on the macroscale. In this approach, anisotropy
	is included in a natural way choosing an anisotropic distribution
	of the beams in the testing volume element (TVE). In addition, damage
	is described on the microscopic level of the individual beams.},

  review = {Green's Functions are heavily emphasized in graduate programs in engineering,

	equation related problems in many fields. Unfortunately, for many
	(like me), the Green's Function (and it's uses) seemed restricted
	to 'textbook' problems. Not anymore.
	
	
	I had to get this book for use at work. Even though Green Functions
	were introduced to me in graduate school, it was never a tool I got
	accustomed to. Because of the necessity (and now ease of use) of
	the Green's Functions, I had to learn to use it effectively. Now,
	with Duffy's book, I'm using as a tool in solving many E'nM and photonic
	problems.
	
	
	Duffy's book on Green's Functions with Applications really develops
	the Green's Function mathematically based on physical and historical
	needs. At first, I thought the book might lead me into too 'mathematical'
	of a diversion than I cared for. Fortunately, this book balances
	mathematical rigor and practical use. Duffy further presses the uses
	of Green's Functions by introducing it into applications. These applications
	give a good run down on the concepts and techniques needed to apply
	it to other problems. Duffy book doesn't alienate the readers, and
	gives plenty of examples to allow the student to work out problems
	on their own.
	
	
	Don't cut yourself short. Green's Functions are a useful tool, and
	Green's Functions with Applications by Dean G. Duffy is an effective
	way of learning to be fully competent with this tool (Green's Functions).

  journal = {Geophysical Journal International},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {179},
  pages = {1703--1725},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {We present a full seismic waveform tomography for upper-mantle structure
	in the Australasian region. Our method is based on spectral-element
	simulations of seismic wave propagation in 3-D heterogeneous earth
	models. The accurate solution of the forward problem ensures that
	waveform misfits are solely due to as yet undiscovered Earth structure
	and imprecise source descriptions, thus leading to more realistic
	tomographic images and source parameter estimates. To reduce the
	computational costs, we implement a long-wavelength equivalent crustal
	model.
	
	
	We quantify differences between the observed and the synthetic waveforms
	using time–frequency (TF) misfits. Their principal advantages are
	the separation of phase and amplitude misfits, the exploitation of
	complete waveform information and a quasi-linear relation to 3-D
	Earth structure. Fréchet kernels for the TF misfits are computed
	via the adjoint method. We propose a simple data compression scheme
	and an accuracy-adaptive time integration of the wavefields that
	allows us to reduce the storage requirements of the adjoint method
	by almost two orders of magnitude.
	
	
	To minimize the waveform phase misfit, we implement a pre-conditioned
	conjugate gradient algorithm. Amplitude information is incorporated
	indirectly by a restricted line search. This ensures that the cumulative
	envelope misfit does not increase during the inversion. An efficient
	pre-conditioner is found empirically through numerical experiments.
	It prevents the concentration of structural heterogeneity near the
	sources and receivers.
	
	
	We apply our waveform tomographic method to$ \approx$ 1000 high-quality
	vertical-component seismograms, recorded in the Australasian region
	between 1993 and 2008. The waveforms comprise fundamental- and higher-mode
	surface and long-period S body waves in the period range from 50
	to 200 s. To improve the convergence of the algorithm, we implement
	a 3-D initial model that contains the long-wavelength features of
	the Australasian region. Resolution tests indicate that our algorithm
	converges after around 10 iterations and that both long- and short-wavelength
	features in the uppermost mantle are well resolved. There is evidence
	for effects related to the non-linearity in the inversion procedure.
	
	
	After 11 iterations we fit the data waveforms acceptably well; with
	no significant further improvements to be expected. During the inversion
	the total fitted seismogram length increases by 46 per cent, providing
	a clear indication of the efficiency and consistency of the iterative
	optimization algorithm. The resulting SV-wave velocity model reveals
	structural features of the Australasian upper mantle with great detail.
	We confirm the existence of a pronounced low-velocity band along
	the eastern margin of the continent that can be clearly distinguished
	against Precambrian Australia and the microcontinental Lord Howe
	Rise. The transition from Precambrian to Phanerozoic Australia (the
	Tasman Line) appears to be sharp down to at least 200 km depth. It
	mostly occurs further east of where it is inferred from gravity and
	magnetic anomalies. Also clearly visible are the Archean and Proterozoic
	cratons, the northward continuation of the continent and anomalously
	low S-wave velocities in the upper mantle in central Australia.
	
	
	This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of non-linear
	full seismic waveform tomography to a continental-scale problem.},

  abstract = {The present work deals with the development of homogenization procedures
	for periodic heterogeneous linear elastic Cosseratmedia. It is resorted
	to asymptotic methods classically used in periodic homogenization.
	It is shown that the nature of the homogeneous equivalent medium
	depends on the hierarchy of three characteristic lengths: the size
	l of the heterogeneities, the Cosserat intrinsic lengths lc of the
	constituents and the typical size L of the considered structure.
	When l and lc are comparable and much smaller than L, the effective
	medium is proved to be a Cauchy continuum with volume couples, whereas
	the case lc?L leads to a Cosserat effective medium. Finite element
	simulations are provided in the case of a fiber-matrix composite
	for a large range of characteristic lengths lc and for two different
	volume fractions. Reference calculations involving every heterogeneity
	are compared to the response obtained using a homogeneous equivalent

  abstract = {The present work deals with the development of homogenization procedures
	for periodic heterogeneous linear elastic Cosseratmedia. It is resorted
	to asymptotic methods classically used in periodic homogenization.
	It is shown that the nature of the homogeneous equivalent medium
	depends on the hierarchy of three characteristic lengths: the size
	l of the heterogeneities, the Cosserat intrinsic lengths lc of the
	constituents and the typical size L of the considered structure.
	When l and lc are comparable and much smaller than L, the effective
	medium is proved to be a Cauchy continuum with volume couples, whereas
	the case lc∼L leads to a Cosserat effective medium. Finite element
	simulations are provided in the case of a fiber-matrix composite
	for a large range of characteristic lengths lc and for two different
	volume fractions. Reference calculations involving every heterogeneity
	are compared to the response obtained using a homogeneous equivalent

	on the San Andreas fault: a point source with moment magnitude M5
	and an extended rupture with M6.5. A method is presented for incorporating
	a source with arbitrary focal mechanism in the grid. Synthetics from
	the 3-D simulations are compared with those derived from 2-D (vertical
	cross section) and 1-D (flat-layered) models. The synthetic seismograms
	from the 3-D and 2-D simulations exhibit large surface waves produced
	by conversion of incident S waves at the edge of the basin. Seismograms
	from the flat-layered model do not contain these converted surface
	waves and underestimate the duration of shaking. The seismograms
	from the 3-D simulations have larger amplitude coda than do the seismograms
	from the 2-D case because of the presence of off-azimuth surface
	wave arrivals in the 3-D simulations that are not included in the
	2-D simulations. Snapshots of the wavefield of the 3-D simulation
	show that these off-azimuth arrivals represent surface waves reflected
	from the edges of the basin. The anelastic attenuation of the sediments
	is a key parameter controlling the overall duration of motion. Some
	of the coda energy at rock sites near the basin edges represents
	leakage of surface wave energy out of the basin. For the M6.5 earthquake
	simulation, the largest ground velocities occur where surface waves
	reflected from the edge of the basin interfere constructively with
	the trapped waves that follow the direct S-wave. Maps of maximum
	ground velocity are produced for two directions of rupture propagation.
	The largest velocities occur in localized portions of the basin.
	The location of the largest velocities changes with the rupture propagation
	direction. Contours of maximum shaking are also dependent on asperity
	positions and radiation pattern.},

	integral equations arising in wave scattering problems involving
	3-D topography and 3-D basin problems. When coupled with an iterative
	solver for linear equations, the fast multipole method can significantly
	reduce memory requirements. The order of operations for the product
	of the matrix obtained from the discretization of the integral kernel
	and a vector is reduced from N2 to the order of p**a N, where p is
	the order of the multipole expansion and a depends on the details

	the translation operators for the multipole expansion need to be
	used in the diagonal form based on a spherical wave decomposition.
	
	
	For problems with topography, the number of iterations required of
	the linear equation solver to achieve convergence is small and no
	preconditioning is necessary. However, for a basin problem, block-diagonal
	preconditioning is essential in the application of the iterative
	solver. Both the memory requirements and the CPU time are considerably

  abstract = {A major challenge when dealing with wave scattering problems over
	infinite or semi-infinite domains via numerical simulation lies on
	the proper consideration of radiation damping. This condition corresponds
	to the geometrical attenuation experienced by perturbations with
	sources inside the computational domain. If the problem is treated
	through a domain discretization method, it is necessary to introduce
	an artificial truncation surface in order to render finite the actual
	infinite domain. As a result, the artificially introduced truncation
	boundary becomes a source of spurious reflections that may considerably
	affect the response inside the computational domain. This inherent
	difficulty in full domain discretizations can be overcome recurring
	to boundary element techniques based on the Green´s functions approach
	which at the same time and depending on the type of Green´s function
	being used, may yield different boundary techniques: In the case
	of Half-Space problems, which are commonly found in seismic engineering
	applications, a rigorous formulation based on the exact Half-Space
	Green’s function is rarely used due to the high computational cost
	spent on the satisfaction of the traction´s free boundary condition.
	As an alternative, approximate formulations in terms of Full-Space
	Green´s functions are frequently used, in which case the radiation
	boundary condition is satisfied at the expense of vilolating the
	free surface boundary condition. The present work aims at identifying
	the simplifying assumptions giving rise to approximate boundary integral
	formulations and moreover to asses the accuracy of each formulation.
	For that purpose a conceptual comparison between classical numerical
	methods for treating wave scattering problems is laid down. With
	that purpose in mind, the Finite Element Method and the Direct Boundary
	Element Method using both, rigorously treated Half-Space Green´s
	functions and Full-Space Green´s functions have been implemented
	within a unified numerical framework. In order to test the algorithm
	several plane wave scattering problems are simulated including scattering
	by a typical structural system resting on a homogeneous Half-Space
	giving rise to a Soil-Structure-Interaction problem. In the finite
	element simulations the truncated part of the Half-Space is replaced
	by the classical silent boundaries proposed by Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer
	(1969) using an excitation in terms of internal sources after Christiano
	and Bielak (1984) to yield a correctly excited model. On the other
	hand, the used Half-Space Boundary Element technique is the one used
	by Kawase (1988) where the Half-Space Green´s function is expressed
	in terms of an analytical part and a correction term expanded into
	a series of discrete wavenumbers. Two additional alternatives using
	Full-Space Green´s functions are explored in order to describe the
	Half-Space. These methods however also require the introduction of
	artificial truncation surfaces. In a first approach we use absorbing
	boundaries along this surface while in the second one we replace
	these artificial boundaries by a prescription of the incoming motions.
	Results are presented both, in the time and frequency domain for
	plane waves incident against a rectangular and a semi-circular canyon
	and for a Soil-Structure Interaction problem.},

	is generated by the 3D Symmetric Galerkin Boundary Element Method
	(SGBEM) and hence can be assembled to the global finite element formulation.
	For the case of combining finite shell elements with 3D boundary
	elements coupling equations in an integral sense are implemented
	as user defined multi point constraints. No user interaction is required
	during the analysis since detection of the coupling configurations,
	setting up and applying the MPCs is realized in an automatic manner.
	An in-house SGBEM code is used in combination with the commercial
	finite element package ABAQUS for automatically coupled FEM/BEM-analyses.
	Basic steps of the automatic coupling procedure are explained and
	necessary background information is provided. Some examples and illustrations

  abstract = {The finite element approach has been previously used, with the help
	of the ATILA code, to model the scattering of acoustic waves by single
	periodic structures, such as compliant tube gratings [A. C. Hennion
	et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87, 1861–1870 (1990)]. In this paper,
	the same approach is extended to doubly periodic structures, such
	as Alberich anechoic coatings. To do this, only the unit cell of
	the periodic structure, including a small part of the surrounding
	fluid domain, has to be meshed, due to the use of classical Bloch
	type relations. Then, the effects of the remaining fluid domain are
	accounted for by matching the pressure field in the finite element
	mesh with simple plane wave expansions of the ingoing and outgoing
	waves. After an outline of the method, the paper describes the results
	obtained for the scattering of a plane wave by different periodic
	structures. Internal losses are taken into account and the incident
	plane wave impinges at normal or oblique incidence. Numerical results
	obtained for Alberich anechoic coatings are first analyzed to check
	the convergence and then compared to previous numerical results or
	to experimental results, demonstrating that the finite element approach
	is accurate and well suited to predict the behavior of these gratings.
	Moreover, careful attention is devoted to the analysis of the inclusion
	vibrations, to identify the origin of the resonance mechanisms.},

	meshes of multiresolution structured and unstructured meshes to simulate
	earthquake ground motion in large basins. While standard octree-based
	mesh methods use cubic elements and rely on mesh refinement to model
	topography, the present hybrid meshes use tetrahedral elements to
	model complicated layer interfaces and above-ground surfaces and
	to provide a transition between cubic elements of different sizes.
	The hybrid meshes avoid the step-like character inherent to the cubic
	meshes and the resulting concomitant loss of accuracy. Several numerical
	experiments of increasing complexity are carried out to verify and
	illustrate the proposed technique.},

  abstract = {Numerical modelling techniques are now becoming common for understanding
	the complicated nature of seismic wave propagation in fractured rock.
	Here the Indirect Boundary Element Method (IBEM) is applied to study
	scattering of elastic waves by cracks. The problem addressed in this
	paper is the diffraction of P and S waves by open 3-D cracks of arbitrary
	shape embedded in a homogeneous isotropic medium. The IBEM yields
	the value of the jump of displacements between opposite surfaces
	of the crack, often called Crack Opening Displacement (COD). This
	is used to evaluate the solution away from the crack. We use a multi-regional
	approach which consists of splitting a surface S into two identical
	surfaces S+ and S− chosen such that the crack lies at the interface.
	The resulting integral equations are not hyper-singular and wave
	propagation within media that contain open cracks can be rigorously
	solved. In order to validate the method, we compare results of displacements
	of a penny-shaped crack for a vertical incident P-wave with the classic
	results by Mal (1970) obtaining excellent agreement. This comparison
	gives us confidence to study cases where no analytic solutions exist.
	Some examples of incidence of P or S waves upon cracks with various
	shapes are depicted and the salient aspects of the method are also
	discussed. Both frequency and time-domain results are included.},

  abstract = {The scattering of elastic waves by cracks is an old problem and various
	ways to solve it have been proposed in the last decades. One approach
	is using dual integral equations, another useful and common formulation
	is the Boundary Element Method (BEM). With the last one, the boundary
	conditions of the crack lead to hyper-singularities and particular
	care should be taken to regularize and solve the resulting integral
	equations.
	
	In this work, instead, the Indirect Boundary Element Method (IBEM)
	is applied to study problems of zero-thickness 2-D cracks. The IBEM
	yields the Crack Opening Displacement (COD) which is used to evaluate
	the solution away from the crack. We use a multiregional approach
	which consists of splitting a boundary S into two identical boundaries
	S+ and S− chosen such that the cracks lie in the interface. The resulting
	integral equations are not hyper-singular and wave propagation within
	media that contain zero-thickness cracks can be rigorously solved.
	
	In order to validate the method, we deal with the scalar case, namely
	the scattering of antiplane SH waves by a 2-D crack. We compare results
	against a recently published analytic solution, obtaining an excellent
	agreement. This comparison gives us confidence to study cases where
	no analytic solutions exist. Some examples of incidence of P- or

	arbitrary high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite-Element method
	to model seismic wave propagation using non-conforming hybrid meshes
	for model discretization and to account for highly heterogeneous
	material. In these new approaches we include a point-wise integration
	of numerical fluxes across element interfaces for the non-conforming
	boundaries preserving numerical accuracy while avoiding numerical
	artifacts due to the mesh coupling. We apply the proposed scheme
	to a scenario test case of the Grenoble valley to demonstrate the
	methods capability. Furthermore, we present the extension to space-variable
	coefficients to describe material variations inside each element
	using the same numerical approximation strategy as for the velocity-stress
	variables in the formulation of the wave equation. The combination
	of the DG method with a time integration scheme based on the solution
	of Arbitrary accuracy DErivatives Riemann problems (ADER) still provides
	an explicit, one-step scheme which achieves arbitrary high-order
	accuracy in space and time. We confirm the accuracy of the proposed
	scheme a numerical experiments considering randomly heterogeneous
	material and compare our results to independent reference solutions.
	Finally, we apply the scheme to an earthquake scenario considering
	the effect of a sedimentary basin and compare the efficiency of the
	classical global time stepping technique and the local time stepping
	for different partitioning strategies and show results for a strong
	scaling test.},

	an innovative numerical approach to the calculation of synthetic

	of a finite element method with the accuracy of a spectral method.
	One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are
	solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free
	surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The
	wavefield on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange
	interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based
	upon the Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre integration rule. This combination
	of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix,
	which greatly simplifies the algorithm. We illustrate the great potential
	of the method by comparing it to a discrete wavenumber/reflectivity
	method for layer-cake models. Both body and surface waves are accurately
	represented, and the method can handle point force as well as moment
	tensor sources. For a model with very steep surface topography we
	successfully benchmark the method against an approximate boundary
	technique. For a homogeneous medium with strong attenuation we obtain

	topography and material interfaces for two- and three-dimensional
	geometries. The spectral element method introduced here is a high-order
	variational method for the spatial approximation of elastic-wave
	equations. The mass matrix is diagonal by construction in this method,
	which drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an efficient
	parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced
	in variational form to simulate unbounded physical domains. The time
	discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving scheme that
	can be put into a classical explicit-implicit predictor/multi-corrector
	format. Long-term energy conservation and stability properties are
	illustrated as well as the efficiency of the absorbing conditions.
	The associated Courant condition behaves as ?tC < O (nel?1/ndN?2),
	with nel the number of elements, nd the spatial dimension, and N
	the polynomial order. In practice, a spatial sampling of approximately
	5 points per wavelength is found to be very accurate when working
	with a polynomial degree of N = 8. The accuracy of the method is
	shown by comparing the spectral element solution to analytical solutions
	of the classical two-dimensional (2D) problems of Lamb and Garvin.
	The flexibility of the method is then illustrated by studying more
	realistic 2D models involving realistic geometries and complex free-boundary
	conditions. Very accurate modeling of Rayleigh-wave propagation,
	surface diffraction, and Rayleigh-to-body-wave mode conversion associated
	with the free-surface curvature are obtained at low computational
	cost. The method is shown to provide an efficient tool to study the
	diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional (3D) surface topographies
	and the associated local effects on strong ground motion. Complex
	amplification patterns, both in space and time, are shown to occur
	even for a gentle hill topography. Extension to a heterogeneous hill
	structure is considered. The efficient implementation on parallel
	distributed memory architectures will allow to perform real-time
	visualization and interactive physical investigations of 3D amplification

	is the difficulty in tackling the irregular free-surface boundary

	are accurately applied by introducing a discretization that uses

	by comparing the numerical results obtained by the trial algorithm
	with the analytical solutions of the Lamb’s problem, for an isotropic

	and describes with particular emphasis its application to doubly

	proposed approach, only the unit cell of the periodic material has
	to be meshed, thanks to Bloch–Floquet relations. The modeling of
	these materials provides dispersion curves from which results of

	modes, cutoff frequencies, passbands, stopbands, as well as effective
	homogeneous properties. In this paper, the general method is first
	described, and particularly the aspects related to the periodicity.
	Then a test example is given for which analytical results exist.
	This example is followed by detailed presentations of finite element
	results, in the case of periodic materials containing inclusions
	or cylindrical pores. The homogenized properties of porous materials
	are determined with the help of an anisotropic model, in the large
	wavelength limit. A validation has been carried out with periodically
	perforated plates, the resonance frequencies of which have been measured.
	The efficiency and the versatility of the method is thus clearly

	the amplitude of shaking at mountain tops and ridges, whereas valleys
	usually have reduced ground motion, as has been observed in both
	records from past earthquakes and numerical simulations. However,
	the effects of realistic topography on ground motion have not often
	been clearly characterized in numerical simulations, especially the
	seismic response of the true ground surface. Here, we use LiDAR DTM
	data, which provide two-meter resolution at the free surface, and
	a spectral-element method to simulate three-dimensional (3D) seismic-wave
	propagation in the Yangminshan region in Taiwan, incorporating the
	effects of realistic topography. A smoothed topographic map is employed
	beneath the model surface in order to decrease mesh distortions due
	to steep ground surfaces. Numerical simulations show that seismic
	shaking in mountainous areas is strongly affected by topography and
	source frequency content. The amplification of ground motion mainly
	occurs at the tops of hills and ridges whilst the valleys and flat-topped
	hills experience lower levels of ground shaking. Interaction between
	small-scale topographic features and high-frequency surface waves
	can produce unusually strong shaking. We demonstrate that topographic
	variations can change peak ground acceleration (PGA) values by ±50%
	in mountainous areas, and the relative change in PGA between a valley
	and a ridge can be as high as a factor of 2 compared to a flat surface
	response. This suggests that high-resolution, realistic topographic
	features should be taken into account in seismic hazard analysis,
	especially for densely populated mountainous areas.},

	amplitude of shaking at mountain tops and ridges, whereas valleys
	have reduced ground motions, as is observed from data recorded during
	and after real earthquakes and from numerical simulations. However,
	recent publications have focused mainly on the implications for ground
	motion in the mountainous regions themselves, whereas the impact
	on surrounding low-lying areas has received less attention. Here,
	we develop a new spectral-element mesh implementation to accommodate
	realistic topography as well as the complex shape of the Taipei sedimentary
	basin, which is located close to the Central Mountain Range in northern
	Taiwan. Spectral-element numerical simulations indicate that high-resolution
	topography can change peak ground velocity (PGV) values in mountainous
	areas by ±50\% compared to a half-space response. We further demonstrate
	that large-scale topography can affect the propagation of seismic
	waves in nearby areas. For example, if a shallow earthquake occurs
	in the I-Lan region of Taiwan, the Central Mountain Range will significantly
	scatter the surface waves and will in turn reduce the amplitude of
	ground motion in the Taipei basin. However, as the hypocenter moves
	deeper, topography scatters body waves, which subsequently propagate
	as surface waves into the basin. These waves continue to interact
	with the basin and the surrounding mountains, finally resulting in
	complex amplification patterns in Taipei City, with an overall PGV
	increase of more than 50%. For realistic subduction zone earthquake
	scenarios off the northeast coast of Taiwan, the effects of topography
	on ground motion in both the mountains and the Taipei basin vary
	and depend on the rupture process. The complex interactions that
	can occur between mountains and surrounding areas, especially sedimentary
	basins, illustrate the fact that topography should be taken into

	membranes, plates) byassum ing the mode shape, and setting the maximum
	values of potential and kinetic

	1908, Ritz laid out his famous method for determining frequencies

	admissible displacement functions, and minimizing a functional involving
	both potential and kinetic
	
	energies. He then demonstrated it in detail in 1909 for the completelyfree

	wrote a paper congratulating Ritz on his work, but stating that he
	himself had used Ritz’s method in many
	
	places in his book and in another publication. Subsequently, hundreds
	of research articles and many books
	
	have appeared which use the method, some calling it the ‘‘Ritz method’’

	method.’’ The present article examines the method in detail, as Ritz
	presented it, and as Rayleigh claimed to
	
	have used it. It concludes that, although Rayleigh did solve a few
	problems which involved minimization of
	
	a frequency, these solutions were not by the straightforward, direct
	method presented by Ritz and used
	
	subsequentlybyothers. Therefore, Rayleigh’s name should not be attached

  abstract = {Wave propagation in a half-space with complex surface configuration
	is often encountered in fields like seismology and ocean engineering.
	This article presents a theoretical study of multiple scattering
	of SH waves by two hills of different geometries (a triangle and
	a semicircle) on a solid half-space. The standing waves in the triangular
	and semicircular hills are constructed by the fractional-order Bessel
	function method and Fourier integral transform method, respectively.
	The unknown coefficients of the standing waves are determined via
	the region-matching method. It is shown that the apexes of the hills
	are very sensitive to the external dynamic load because of multiple
	incidences; in particular, the apex of the triangular hill exhibiting
	maximum amplitude is most susceptible to the external load. Furthermore,
	the effect of the interaction between the triangular and semicircular
	hills is evaluated. It is found that the amplitudes on the showdown
	zone that connects the two hills have been largely amplified due
	to the interaction between the two hills. The mutual interaction
	between the hills should not be neglected if the distance between
	them is less than O(100) times the typical dimension of the hill.},

	the solution from spurious modes, that can be found sometimes in
	classical finite element simulations. Many examples of such non-physical
	solutions exist in literature, and elimination of these spurious
	effects is a subject of great interest. Spectral elements are a numerical
	technique for solving partial differential equations which can be
	regarded as an extension of finite elements: they merge the flexibility
	of finite elements in dealing with complex geometries, and the better
	accuracy of spectral methods. Convergence to exact solution is improved
	by increasing (at run time) the polynomial degree, with no changes
	on the computational grid: this provides a significant advantage
	in respect to low order finite element, which necessarily have to
	resort to grid refinement. In the authors opinion this approach can
	be successfully used for the treatment of large scale electromagnetic
	problems or, alternatively, for applications where higher precision
	is required. We present a few numerical experiments which prove the
	capability of the method in object.},

  abstract = {We present a weighted-averaging frequency-domain finite-element method
	for an accurate and efficient 2D elastic wave modeling technique.
	Our method introduces three kinds of supplementary element sets in
	addition to a basic element set that is used in the standard finite-element
	method. By constructing global stiffness and mass matrices for four
	kinds of element sets and then averaging them with weighting coefficients,
	we obtain a new global stiffness and mass matrix. With optimal weighting
	coefficients determined by a Marquardt–Levenberg method to minimize
	grid dispersion and grid anisotropy, we can reduce the number of
	nodal points per shear wavelength from 33.3 (using the standard finite-element
	method) and 20 (using the eclectic method) to 5, with the errors
	of group velocities no larger than 1%. By reducing the number of
	grid points per wavelength, we achieve a 97% and 75% reduction of
	computer memory required to store the complex impedance matrix for
	a band-type matrix solver and a nested dissection method, respectively,
	compared with those of the eclectic method.
	
	
	Our method gives approximate solutions compatible with exact solutions
	for an infinite homogeneous, a semi-infinite homogeneous (Lamb's
	problem), and a horizontal two-layer model with fewer grid points
	than the standard and the eclectic method. A major advantage of the
	weighted-averaging finite-element method for the elastic wave equation
	is that it provides solutions very close to correct solutions for
	Lamb's problem economically, unlike most of the displacement approaches.
	In addition, our scheme makes the complex impedance matrix symmetric,
	which satisfies reciprocity. Seismic forward modeling techniques
	that satisfy reciprocity are of critical importance in seismic imaging
	and inversion because we can economically calculate a Jacobian matrix
	using the reciprocity. Successful simulation of a large-size model
	shows that our method can be used for the simulation of wave propagation
	in the geological model needed in the reverse-time migration or seismic
	inversion.},

	In the present work, we describe the lattice Boltzmann methodology

	effective values for one- and two-dimensional simulations, if one
	uses the isotropic approximation. We find that use of the D2Q9 lattice
	for phonon transport leads to erroneous results in transient ballistic
	simulations, and the D2Q7 lattice should be employed for two-dimensional
	simulations. Furthermore, we show that at the ballistic regime, the
	effect of direction discretization becomes apparent in two dimensions,
	regardless of the lattice used. Numerical methodology, lattice structure,
	and implementation of initial and different boundary conditions for

	Editorial
	
	
	Norris and Shuvalov [8] extend the concept of transformation optics
	to linear elasticity. They answer the question of what is the
	
	most general type of metamaterial that can mimic the effects of an
	elastic region and thereby form a passive elastic wave cloaking
	
	device. The paper shows that the transformed material properties are
	non-unique, and form a spectrum of materials ranging from
	
	non-local constitutive behavior exemplified by the Willis model, to
	purely local elastic response with non-symmetric stress.
	
	
	
	----
	
	
	They presented a general tranformation in comparison with Mitlon work.
	They establish how the elastodynamic equations could be invariant
	if a non-symmetric (Cosserat like) stress tensor is used.},

	scheme. When zero-stress is applied to free surfaces, the resulting
	finite difference schemes require a set of adjacent fictitious points.
	These points are classified based on the geometry of the free surface
	and their displacement is computed as a prior step to later calculation
	of motion on the crack surface. The use of this extra line of points
	does not involve a significant drain on computational resources.
	However, it does provide explicit finite difference schemes and the
	construction of displacement on the free surfaces by using the correct
	physical boundary conditions. An accuracy analysis compares the results
	to an analytical solution. This quantitative analysis uses envelope
	and phase misfits. It estimates the minimum number of points per

	- a NS cross section through the Palos Grandes district - to seismic
	excitations such as those due to antiplane line (point) sources and

	sloped northern edge of the valley is a more efficient generator
	and reflector of surface waves than the midly sloped southern edge.
	Also the spectral amplification and time response characteristics
	of this asymmetric wedge-shaped valley are a function of the direction
	of incidence of the excitation waves (e.g., incidence from the north
	versus incidence from the south versus vertical incidence).
	
	
	The same 2-D model of the valley is used to simulate also the antiplane
	response of the valley to synthetic strong motions equivalent - in
	amplitude, frequency content, and duration - to those that most likely
	were generated by the 29 July 1967 Caracas earthquake. This event
	has been found to consist of four subevents, of which the second
	subevent - located at a distance of 25 km from the valley - caused
	the damage in Caracas. The source spectrum of each of the subevents
	used in the generation of the synthetic time histories was assumed
	to be a simple omega-square model. The locations, relative times
	of occurrence, seismic moments, and mechanisms of the subevents were
	available from an inversion study of teleseismic data. It is found
	that peak acceleration was fairly uniform across the valley, varying
	from 0.15 to 0.21 g. On the contrary, peak velocities and peak rotational
	(torsional) strains varied considerably (factor of 2 to 3) across
	the valley, with the maximum values being 25 cm / sec for velocity
	and 1.5 * 10-4 for rotational strain. For sites in Palos Grandes,

	of the intensity of motion on rock and on the sediments are higher

  review = {Why another book on the finite element method? There are currently
	more than 200 books in print with "Finite Element Method" in their
	titles. Many are devoted to special topics or emphasize error analysis
	and numerical accuracy. Others stick to the fundamentals and do little
	to describe the development and implementation of algorithms for
	solving real-world problems. Introduction to Finite and Spectral
	Element Methods Using MATLAB provides a means of quickly understanding
	both the theoretical foundation and practical implementation of the
	finite element method and its companion spectral element method.
	Written in the form of a self-contained course, it introduces the
	fundamentals on a need-to-know basis and emphasizes algorithm development
	and computer implementation of the essential procedures. Firmly asserting
	the importance of simultaneous practical experience when learning
	any numerical method, the author provides FSELIB: a software library
	of user-defined MATLAB functions and complete finite and spectral
	element codes. FSELIB is freely available for download from http://dehesa.freeshell.org,
	which is also a host for the book, providing further information,
	links to resources, and FSELIB updates. The presentation is suitable
	for both self-study and formal course work, and its state-of-the-art
	review of the field make it equally valuable as a professional reference.
	With this book as a guide, you immediately will be able to run the
	codes as given and graphically display solutions to a wide variety
	of problems in heat transfer and solid, fluid, and structural mechanics.},

	the surface motion at a given site due to the incoming and scattered
	seismic waves by surface geology. This can be formulated in terms
	of diffraction of elastic waves and then the indirect boundary element
	method (IBEM) for dynamic elasticity is used. It is based on the
	explicit construction of diffracted waves at the boundaries from
	which they radiate. This provides the analyst with insight on the
	physics of diffraction. The IBEM has been applied to study the amplification
	of elastic waves in irregular soil profiles. From the strong or weak
	satisfaction of boundary conditions and a simple analytical discretization
	scheme a linear system of equations for the boundary sources is obtained.
	Here, we explore the use of a weak discretization strategy with more
	collocation points than force densities. The least squares enforcement
	of boundary conditions leads to a system with reduced number of unknowns.
	This approach naturally allows one to use both coarser and finer
	boundary discretizations for smooth and rapidly varying profiles,
	respectively. A well studied semicircular canyon under incident P
	or SV in-plane waves is used to calibrate this method. Several benefits
	are obtained using mixed meshing that leads to the least squares

  abstract = {Cellular structures like honeycombs or reticulated micro-frames are
	widely used in sandwich construction because of their superior structural
	static and dynamic properties. The aim of this study is to evaluate
	the dynamic behavior of two-dimensional cellular structures, with
	the focus on the effect of the geometry of unit cells on the dynamics
	of the propagation of elastic waves within the structure. 
	
	
	The characteristics of wave propagation for the considered class of
	cellular solids are analyzed through the finite element model of
	the unit cell and the application of the theory of periodic structures.
	This combined analysis yields the phase constant surfaces, which
	define the directions of waves propagating in the plane of the structure
	for the assigned frequency values. The analysis of iso-frequency
	contour lines in the phase constant surfaces allows the prediction
	of the location and extension of angular ranges, and therefore regions
	within the structures where waves do not propagate. 
	
	
	The performance of honeycomb grids of regular hexagonal topology is
	compared with that of grids of various geometries, with the emphasis
	on configurations featuring a negative Poisson’s ratio behavior.
	The harmonic response of the considered structures at specified frequencies
	confirms the predictions from the analysis of the phase constant
	surfaces and demonstrates the strongly spatially-dependent characteristics
	of periodic cellular structures.
	
	
	The numerical results presented indicate the potentials of the phase
	constant surfaces as tools for the evaluation of the wave propagation
	characteristics of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures.
	Optimal design configurations can be identified in order to achieve
	the desired transmissibility levels in specified directions and to
	obtain efficient vibration isolation capabilities. The findings from
	the presented investigations and the described analysis methodology
	will provide invaluable guidelines for the prototyping of future
	concepts of honeycombs or cellular structures with enhanced vibro-acoustics
	performance.},

	anomalies, various examples that cover extreme cases are presented.
	It is found that topography may cause significant effects both of
	amplification and of deamplification at the irregular feature itself

	Various types of incident waves are considered to analyze the physical
	characteristics of the response: symmetries, amplifications, impulse
	response and the like. Computations are performed in the frequency
	domain and lead to time response using Fourier analysis. In the present
	implementation a symmetrical model is used to test symmetries. The
	boundaries of each region are discretized into boundary elements
	whose size depends on the shortest wavelength, typically, six boundary
	segments per wavelength. Usually, the seismic response of rockfill
	dams is simulated using either finite elements (FEM) or finite differences
	(FDM). In most applications, commercial tools that combine features
	of these methods are used to assess the seismic response of the system
	for a given motion at the base of model. However, in order to consider
	realistic excitation of seismic waves with different incidence angles
	and azimuth we explore the IBEM.},

	possible to consider various numerical approaches: the finite difference
	method, the spectral element method, the boundary element method,
	the finite element method, the finite volume method, etc. All these
	methods have various advantages and drawbacks. The amplification
	of seismic waves in surface soil layers is mainly due to the velocity
	contrast between these layers and, possibly, to topographic effects
	around crests and hills. The influence of the geometry of alluvial
	basins on the amplification process is also know to be large. Nevertheless,
	strong heterogeneities and complex geometries are not easy to take
	into account with all numerical methods. 2D/3D models are needed
	in many situations and the efficiency/accuracy of the numerical methods
	in such cases is in question. Furthermore, the radiation conditions
	at infinity are not easy to handle with finite differences or finite/spectral
	elements whereas it is explicitely accounted in the Boundary Element
	Method. Various absorbing layer methods (e.g. F-PML, M-PML) were
	recently proposed to attenuate the spurious wave reflections especially
	in some difficult cases such as shallow numerical models or grazing
	incidences. Finally, strong earthquakes involve nonlinear effects
	in surficial soil layers. To model strong ground motion, it is thus
	necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of soils and
	simultaneously investigate seismic wave propagation in complex 2D/3D
	geological structures! Recent advances in numerical formulations
	and constitutive models in such complex situations are presented
	and discussed in this paper. A crucial issue is the availability
	of the field/laboratory data to feed and validate such models.},

	by the DST threatens the Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian populations
	alike. Several deep and structurally complex sedimentary basins are
	associated with the DST. These basins are up to 10 km deep and typically
	bounded by active fault zones.
	
	The low seismicity of the DST, the sparse seismic network, and limited
	coverage of sedimentary basins result in a critical knowledge gap.
	Therefore, it is necessary to complement the limited instrumental
	data with synthetic data based on computational modeling, in order
	to study the effects of earthquake ground motion in these sedimentary
	basins.
	
	In this research we performed a 2D ground?motion analysis in the Dead
	Sea Basin (DSB) using a finite?difference code. Cross sections transecting
	the DSB were compiled for wave propagation simulations. Results indicate
	a complex pattern of ground?motion amplification affected by the
	geometric features in the basin.
	
	To distinguish between the individual contributions of each geometrical
	feature in the basin, we developed a semiquantitative decomposition
	approach. This approach enabled us to interpret the DSB results as
	follows: (1) Ground?motion amplification as a result of resonance
	occurs basin?wide due to a high impedance contrast at the base of
	the uppermost layer; (2) Steep faults generate a strong edge?effect
	that further amplifies ground motions; (3) Sub?basins cause geometrical
	focusing that may significantly amplify ground motions; and (4) Salt
	diapirs diverge seismic energy and cause a decrease in ground?motion
	amplitude.},

	to the surface of a half space are considered for antiplane shear
	wave incidence. The method of separation of variables is adopted
	to derive an exact series solution. The total displacement field
	is expressed as infinite series containing products of radial and
	angular Mathieu functions with unknown coefficients. An exact analytical
	determination of unknown coefficients is carried out by insuring
	the vanishing of normal stresses on crack faces. Frequency-domain
	results are given for extremely near, near, and far fields, whereas
	time-domain ones are for horizontal surface and subsurface motions.
	Comparisons with published data for the dynamic stress intensity
	factor show good agreement. The exact analytical nature of proposed
	solutions can be applied very conveniently and rapidly to high-frequency
	steady-state cases, enhancing the computation efficiency in transient
	cases when performing the fast Fourier transform. A sampled set of
	time slices for underground wave propagation benefits the interpretation
	of scattering and diffraction phenomena induced by a vertical edge

	of shock wave propagation in elastic solids. The method, which implements
	a flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, contains three stages:
	collision, streaming, and correction. In the collision stage, distribution
	functions are updated. In the streaming stage, the distribution functions
	are shifted between lattice points. Generally, a partial differential
	equation (PDE) is solved in the streaming stage, and finite element
	methods are employed to support the use of unstructured meshes in
	the LB method. The FCT algorithm is used in the correction stage
	to revise the distribution functions at lattice points, so fluctuations
	behind shock wave fronts can be eliminated efficiently. In this method,
	schemes for shock wave reflection at fixed and free boundaries are
	developed based on the bounce-back technique. A similar technique
	is used to treat wave reflection and transmission at material interfaces
	of composites. Several one-dimensional examples show that this LB-FCT
	method can provide ideal depictions of shock wave propagation in
	structures, especially composite structures.},

	difficulty that the boundary methods have. The sparse matrix approximation
	can be a countermeasure for the weakest point of the boundary methods,
	i. e., requirement of huge memory allocation and unacceptable
	
	long CPU time consumption. The elimination of relatively small matrix
	elements, however, may result in a considerable distortion of calculated
	wave field. The higher order Born approximation is expected to be
	
	able to restore it. Therefore, their combination has a possibility
	to improve the efficiency and accuracy together for conventional
	IBEM. 
	
	
	It is shown that the third order Born approximation provides an enough
	accurate solution and at the same time reduces drastically the required
	CPU time and memory allocation in a case study and that the
	
	contribution of boundary elements nearer than the wavelength at the
	peak frequency have to be integrated. The calculated results show
	that the distortion of the main phases that correspond to the interaction
	
	between the boundary elements relatively near each other can be recovered.
	This implies that the refinement of synthetic seismograms may work
	better for the problems, in that surface waves and interface
	
	waves do not play important role. Possible example may be the body
	waves in relatively high frequency range that propagate through irregular
	interfaces, e. g., acceleration observed on irregularly layered

  abstract = {Several examples are used to verify the domain reduction method (DRM),
	a two-step finite-element methodology described in a companion article
	for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous three-dimensional
	localized regions. The first set involves a simple, flat-layered
	system. Verification of the DRM for this problem is carried out by
	comparing the results to those calculated directly by the theoretical
	Green's function method. Its applicability to more general problems
	is illustrated by two examples: a basin and a hill with and without
	a weathered surface layer and with the same stratigraphy. We use
	a Green's function approach for the first step, which for the examples
	under consideration needs to be performed only once. For the second
	step, the domain of computation is reduced in each case to a small
	neighborhood of the geological feature at hand. The second application
	considers the ground motion due to a strike-slip double couple buried
	14 km below the free surface in an 80-km × 80-km × 30-km region that
	encloses entirely the Los Angeles basin. This problem is solved first
	by the finite-element method using the single-step traditional approach,
	in which the ground motion is calculated simultaneously near the
	seismic source, along the propagation path, and within the region
	of interest with a single model that encompasses the entire geological
	structure, from the source to the region of interest. The DRM is
	then used to determine anew the ground motion over a much smaller
	(6-km × 6-km × 0.6-km) region contained within the original domain,
	and the results of the two methods within this region of interest
	are compared.
	
	
	These examples serve to demonstrate that in many applications the
	DRM can be significantly more efficient than the traditional approach.
	The DRM can be particularly advantageous (1) if the source is far
	from the local structure and the local structure is much softer than
	that of the exterior region, (2) if the localized feature exhibits
	nonlinear behavior, or (3) if for a prescribed source, one wishes
	to consider a sequence of simulations in which the properties of
	the local feature, which might include man-made structures, are varied
	from one simulation to the next.},
